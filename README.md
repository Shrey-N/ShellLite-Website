# ShellLite Website

The official website for **ShellLite**, written **100% purely in ShellLite**.

**Live at:** [shelllite.tech](http://shelllite.tech)

## About
This project demonstrates the capabilities of ShellLite as a web server language. Everything from the routing to the compiler backend is implemented using `shl` scripts.

## Running Locally

1. **Install ShellLite**:
   ```bash
   pip install shell-lite
   ```

2. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   shl run main.shl
   ```

3. **Visit**: `http://localhost:8080`

## Structure
- `main.shl`: The core web server and router.
- `compiler.shl`: The logic for the online compiler.
- `public/`: Static assets (CSS, JS, binaries).
